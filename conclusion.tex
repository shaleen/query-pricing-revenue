\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we study the problem of revenue maximization in the context of query-based pricing.
We cast the task as a bundle pricing problem for single-minded buyers and unlimited supply, and then
perform a detailed experimental evaluation on the effectiveness of various approximation
algorithms that provide different worst-case approximation guarantees. Our results show that the specific
bundle structure often means that simple item-pricing algorithms perform much better than their worst-case
guarantees.  

There are several open questions that remain. First, is it possible to 
come up with algorithms and approximation analyses that are beyond worst-case, and take into account
the structure of either the bundles, or the valuations? Further, can we design 
algorithms that directly construct XOS pricing functions that can perform better than either item pricing
or uniform bundle pricing?
