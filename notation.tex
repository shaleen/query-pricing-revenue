\section{Notation and Preliminaries}

We assume that there are $m$ customers (hyperedges) and $n$ items. Since we are in the {\em unlimited supply setting}, the seller has zero marginal cost  for each item, i.e, the seller can sell any number of units of each item. Additionally, the buyers are  {\em single minded}, which means that each customer is interested in buying only a single set of items corresponding to the hyperedge $e$ for price $v_e$. Buyers will purchase $e$ only if the price assigned to bundle $e$ is atmost $v_e$. We will use $p^{b}_e$ and $p^{i}_e$ to denote the bundle and item prices respectively assigned by the algorithm.
