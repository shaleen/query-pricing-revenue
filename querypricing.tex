\textbf{\textit{Question 1.}} Given $m$ customers (hyperedges) and their valuations $v_i$, what is the revenue gap between the optimal arbitrage free pricing and: $(i)$ item pricing $(ii)$ uniform bundle pricing, using the pricing function $p^{a}(Q,\mathcal{D})$.

We show that the gap is $\Omega(m)$ for uniform bundle pricing and this is tight. For item pricing, we show that gap is $\Omega(m)$. Given these results, it is tantalizing to wonder whether XOS pricing functions (rather than single additive function) helps bridge the revenue gap.

\textbf{\textit{Question 2.}} Given $m$ customers (hyperedges) and their valuations $v_i$, what is the revenue gap between the optimal arbitrage free pricing and XOS pricing function.

Our main result for the second question is
