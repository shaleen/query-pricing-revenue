\section{Uniform Bundle and Item Pricing}

In this section, we provide some worst-case guarantees on how well uniform bundle pricing and item pricing can approximate the 
optimal subadditive and monotone bundle pricing.

\paragraph{Upper Bounds.}
It is a folklore result that for any hypergraph $\mH = (\mV, \mE)$ with valuations $\{v_e\}_{e \in \mE}$, one can always construct a uniform bundle price that is $O(\log m)$ away from
the sum of valuations $\sum_e v_e$, which is an upper bound on the optimal subadditive and monotone bundle pricing (for completeness, we provide a proof in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix}). Similarly, we know from~\cite{cheung2008approximation} that item pricing can achieve a $O(\log B)$ approximation of the sum of valuations. Recall that 
$B$ is the maximum number of hyperedges that a vertex can be contained in, and hence $B \leq m$. 

\paragraph{Lower Bounds.}
The upper bound of $O(\log m)$ is tight in the worst case for both uniform item pricing and bundle pricing. In particular, we show the following stronger results:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a hypergraph instance with additive valuations where any uniform bundle price produces revenue that is $\Omega(\log m)$ away from the optimal (Lemma~\ref{lem:lb1} in the appendix).
\item There exists a hypergraph instance with uniform valuations (\ie, each buyer has the same valuation for any hyperedge) where any item pricing produces revenue that is $\Omega(\log m)$ away from the optimal (Lemma~\ref{lem:lb2} in the appendix).
\item There exists a hypergraph instance with submodular valuations where any item pricing {\em and} any uniform bundle pricing is  $\Omega(\log m)$ away from the optimal (Lemma~\ref{lem:lb3} in the appendix).
\end{enumerate}
