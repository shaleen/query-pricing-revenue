\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present approximation algorithms for {\em query pricing} problem so as to maximize seller's revenue in the unlimited supply setting. We formulate the problem as an instance item pricing over {\em item hypergraph} where the buyers are {\em single minded} with subadditive valuations and investigate a variety of pricing strategies including {\em uniform item pricing} and {\em uniform bundle pricing}. \cite{guruswami2005profit} gave an $O(\log m + \log n)$ where $m$ is the number of customers and $n$ is the number of items with sum of all valuations as the upper bound. In our setting, we show that both item pricing and uniform bundle pricing exhibit a gap of $\Omega(m)$ from the optimal subadditive bundle pricing. Additionally, we investigate the revenue obtained using XOS pricing functions and show $O(\dots)$ approximation with a matching lower bound. We complement our theoretical results with extensive experiments on industry scale workloads. To this end, our experiments show that pricing algorithms behave very well in practice when valuations are drawn randomly from a variety of distributions including zipfian, normal and uniform distribution.
